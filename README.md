# Hi 👋, I'm Vincent

</div>

I'm a Master Student at TU Berlin, and a Research Assistant at Fraunhofer FOKUS. My main areas of study (and work) are machine learning and software development.

I also enjoy cooking, especially with the open-source Nextcloud [Cookbook Client](https://github.com/VincentMeilinger/Nextcloud-Cookbook-iOS) iOS app 🍉. 
In case you ...
- host or use a Nextcloud instance
- enjoy the art of cooking
- have already set up the Nextcloud Cookbook cloud service
  
... you should definitely check it out! 
And who knows, if this ingenious application turns you into a seasoned home chef, consider contributing to it 😏!
